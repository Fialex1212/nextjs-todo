# Todo App (Next.js)

This is a simple Todo app built with **Next.js** and **React**, using state management through a custom store (`useTodoStore`) and styled with CSS Modules.

## Features

- **Create Todos**: Add new tasks to your todo list.
- **Toggle Todo Completion**: Mark tasks as completed by clicking a checkbox.
- **Delete Todos**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Popup Menu**: Each task has a menu for deletion that opens when the `Ellipsis` button is clicked.
- **Click Outside to Close Menu**: The menu will close automatically if you click outside of it.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef` for managing component state and lifecycle.
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped styling for the app.
- **Lucide Icons**: For the menu button (ellipsis icon).
- **Zustand Store**: State management for todos.
